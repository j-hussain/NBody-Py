# N-Body
A python implementation for the N-body problem; this program uses Newton's law of Universal Gravitation. This was my prototype for an Nbody simulation, using standard Euler integration (per unit time step) to calculate the force exerted on/between the particles; I will rewrite this in Java using the Barnes-Hut algorithm to increase code execution, and the use of JavaFX.
